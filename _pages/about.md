Hi, thanks for stopping by! 

I am Guangsheng Bao, currently a Ph.D. candidate at [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/) and [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), where I have the privilege of being advised by Prof. [Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io/). My primary research interests lie in the field of **trustworthy NLP**, encompassing topics like model **generalization**, the creation of **explainable and controllable** NLP systems, ensuring the **safe application** of LLMs, and understanding the **reasoning capabilities** of LLMs. I have disseminated my research outcomes across a range of publications presented at esteemed conferences including ACL, ICLR, EMNLP, TASLP, and AAAI.

In addition to my research, I've been actively involved in the academic community as a reviewer for conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, ICML, NIPS, TACL, COLING, and more. I've also had the honor of serving as an area chair for COLING 2022.

Before diving into the world of scientific research, I gained valuable experience at [Alibaba](https://damo.alibaba.com/about?tab=0&language=en), contributing to customer service robot systems, and at [Microsoft (China)](https://www.microsoft.com/zh-cn/ard/aboutus/overview.aspx), where I worked on Cortana. Feel free to reach out if you would like to chat about any of these topics or if you have any questions!
