Hi, thanks for stopping by! 

I am Guangsheng Bao, currently a Ph.D. candidate at [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/) and [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), where I have the privilege of being mentored by Prof. [Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io/). My main focus in the realm of research centers around Natural Language Generation, which includes areas like Large Language Models, Neural Machine Translation, and Text Summarization. I've had the opportunity to share my findings through various publications in conferences like ACL, AAAI, EMNLP, and TASLP.

In addition to my research, I've been actively involved in the academic community as a reviewer for conferences such as ACL, EMNLP, ICML, NIPS, TACL, COLING, and more. I've also had the honor of serving as an area chair for COLING 2022.

Before diving into the world of scientific research, I gained valuable experience at Alibaba, contributing to customer service robot systems, and at Microsoft (China), where I worked on Cortana. Feel free to reach out if you would like to chat about any of these topics or if you have any questions!
