Hi, thanks for stopping by! 

I am Guangsheng Bao, a Ph.D. candidate at [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/) and [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Yue Zhang](https://frcchang.github.io/).
My primary research interests lie in Natural Language Generation, including Large Language Model, Neural Machine Translation, and Text Summarization.
I published various papers on ACL, AAAI, EMNLP, and TASLP. I served as a reviewer for ACL, EMNLP, ICML, NIPS, TACL, COLING, etc., and as an area chair for COLING 2022.
